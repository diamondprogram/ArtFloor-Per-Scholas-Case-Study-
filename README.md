# ArtFloor-Per-Scholas-Case-Study-


# Background infromation
During the duration of the training course offered by Per Scholas sponsored by Barclays, each student was responsible for an independent Case Study. We were to take the technologies and skills we learned through out the course (Core JAVA, JPA, TOMCAT, SQL, MariaDB, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and implement them into the project.
Each Student was free to chose what their Case Study would be about. Once the Instructor approved of the project development of it would begin.


# About the Project/Case Study

My case Study was inspired by Art sharing sites like Pintrest, Art station and others, where users can upload custom art pieces and share them
with the community. 

The web application was made using JAVA/JPA to handle all of the logic, TOMCAT was used as the webserver and HTML(JSP), CSS and a bit of 
Javascript for the front end.

Users can sign up for thre service by simplying submitting a username and password and can sign into their account by entering their credentials on
the login page.

Users can Browse the most recent images on the home page under the different taged categories, search for images whos title contains a certian keyword.
clicking on the imges will result in the user being brought to the image's post page where they can view the image full size, they can also leave a like and
add a comment on a post and view the creator's profile page.

The Profile page displays the Account's username, the date they joined how many likes they recieved intotal from all of their posts and at the bottom 
of the page are all of the post they made.

Users can also upload their own images, they need to provide a name, a description (optional), chose one of the premade tags then chose and image to upload.

There are still features I wish to add to this project to make it better even after my Per Scholas Course is over.
